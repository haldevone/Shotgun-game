This project was created as a school assignment to practice event-driven programming, UI development, and game logic in C#.
It requires the player to login for tracking highscore.

Player and AI face off in a duel:

Each round, a player can choose an action (e.g., Load, Block, Shoot, Supershotgun).

The game tracks ammo, life and player states.

The first to outsmart their opponent wins.

The game is played with a graphical interface (WinForms).
